     Rendering parity by CONSTRUCTION (user bugs 2026-07-06): the label uses
     the exact clip-fill technique of the settled \`.connect-station-label\`
     (anything else renders CJK strokes at a different weight \u2014 plain text
     takes Windows subpixel AA and lands visibly bolder; font-smoothing is
     macOS-only and can't equalize). The clip-fill's squash-in-flight is
     prevented positionally, in the spirit of useRiseAnimation's "never
     transform text" rule: the label is pinned to the clone's box (inset:0 \u2014
     by settle that IS the button's 240\xD756 footprint, TARGET_W/H in
     useConnectMorph) on its OWN compositor layer, so its raster never
     resizes and never paints into the clone's stretching texture. It fades
     in from 220ms, by which time the clone is already near that footprint.
     Centering mirrors .connect-station exactly (same grid + line-height):
     inset:0 sits on the padding box (+1px each side inside the 1px border),
     and for CENTERED content that offset cancels \u2014 the text center equals
     the station's, so the hand-off is coordinate-exact (user 2026-07-06:

   the well is hidden after the collapse plays (visibility waits out the

   a 240ms signature = 0.72\xB2). Every "too fast" report on this collapse was
   that square. The close therefore runs \`linear\`, which the quirk turns
   into (1\u2212t)\xB2 \u2014 a clean quadratic ease-out that actually spans the 360ms
   (56% left at 90ms, 25% at 180, 6% at 270). The open keeps the signature

/* The clip IS the dark rounded well (owner 2026-08-19, screenshots): the

   opaque box \u2014 a rectangle bottom sliding up while the panel's top edge
   (the panel is bottom-anchored) came down. With the background / border /
   radius on the clip box, the box that shrinks with the grid row is the
   shape itself: both corners stay rounded through the whole travel and the
   text simply disappears behind its own bottom border. (The earlier
   scaleY-toward-top + fast-fade recipe is only good for a short element
   like the sidebar search field; a 130\u2013240px opaque well needs the shrinking
   box to BE the chrome.) The close fades the box only over its last
   stretch (from ~1/5 height on) so the shrink is the story and it

   2026-09-02 (owner: on every toggle the device card "bounced" left-right
   and its PNG sat in the middle of a half-width card, then drifted to the
   card's true middle as the card widened). Two causes, traced by seeking
   the transitions frame by frame: translateX(130%) resolved against the
   rail's OWN box, which rode the collapsing 338px\u21920 track \u2014 130% \xD7 a
   shrinking width is a hump, and the card's place-items:center re-centred
   the device in each frame's sliver. The rail was pinned at --rail-w (see
   .utility-rail) and the translate added --viewer-w to cancel the slot's
   own drift \u2014 which held only while the two moved in lockstep.

   2026-09-11 (owner: on close the cards "suddenly appear in the middle of
   the empty space", get "pushed to the edge of the app", then "jump back";
   most often after a width drag or with several tabs open). The transform
   runs on the COMPOSITOR thread; the grid-template-columns slide that
   moved the rail's slot runs on the MAIN thread. A busy main thread at
   close \u2014 the record re-wrapping to a wider column every frame, the tabs'
   views unmounting \u2014 lets the rail finish its slide over a FROZEN slot,
   and when layout catches up the slot drags the rail to the edge and it
   snaps back (reproduced with a 350ms stall: screencast frames 437/660/803
   are the owner's three pictures). No compensation term can hold two
   threads in step, so the rail LEAVES the grid for both slides: absolute
   on its rest geometry (the padding tokens \u2014 the same box as its track),
   translated a constant 777px (2.3 \xD7 --rail-w, the disconnect slide's
   338 + 1.3 \xD7 338) with no --viewer-w term, because the slot no longer
   moves under it. The shell holds \`viewer-closing\` for the close slide's
   length (the grid's own transitionend), and only then does the rail
   become the track item again \u2014 at the same place and width. Under any
   stall the rail now arrives at its rest and waits for the conversation.
   The transform starts WITH the track (delay 0); the fade keeps its 120ms
